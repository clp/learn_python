<p><strong><em>Summary of Answers</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: can express binary using <code>int('01010101111',2)</code> but not with a literal.</li>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: there is <em>no way</em> to express binary literals.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so: <code>0b1100111</code> or <code>0B1100111</code>.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: will also allow <code>0o27</code> or <code>0O27</code> (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.</li>
<li>Python 3.0 beta: Same as 2.6, but will no longer allow the older <code>027</code> syntax for octals.</li>

<li>Divide it into groups based on some criteria</li>
<li>Then later iterate over each of these groups separately.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've reviewed <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html"">the documentation</a>, and <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby"">the examples</a>, but I've had trouble trying to apply them beyond a simple list of numbers. </p>

<p>So, how do I use of <code>itertools.groupby()</code>?  Is there another technique I should be using?  Pointers to good ""prerequisite"" reading would also be appreciated.</p>
"
783,773.0,189.0,2008-08-03T18:40:09Z,52,,"<p>Can you show us your code?</p>

<p>The example on the Python docs is quite straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>groups = []
uniquekeys = []
for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):
    groups.append(list(g))      # Store group iterator as a list
    uniquekeys.append(k)
</code></pre>

<p>So in your case, data is a list of nodes, keyfunc is where the logic of your criteria function goes and then <code>groupby()</code> groups the data.</p>

<p>You must be careful to <strong>sort the data</strong> by the criteria before you call <code>groupby</code> or it won't work. <code>groupby</code> method actually just iterates through a list and whenever the key changes it creates a new group.</p>
"
7286,773.0,207.0,2008-08-10T18:45:32Z,394,,"<p>As Sebastjan said, <strong>you first have to sort your data. This is important.</strong></p>

<p>The part I didn't get is that in the example construction</p>

<pre><code>groups = []
uniquekeys = []
for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):
   groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list
   uniquekeys.append(k)
</code></pre>

<p><code>k</code> is the current grouping key, and <code>g</code> is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. In other words, the <code>groupby</code> iterator itself returns iterators.</p>

<p>Here's an example of that, using clearer variable names:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import groupby

things = [(""animal"", ""bear""), (""animal"", ""duck""), (""plant"", ""cactus""), (""vehicle"", ""speed boat""), (""vehicle"", ""school bus"")]

for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    for thing in group:
        print ""A %s is a %s."" % (thing[1], key)
    print "" ""
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you the output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bear is a animal.<br>
  A duck is a animal.</p>
  
  <p>A cactus is a plant.</p>
  
  <p>A speed boat is a vehicle.<br>
  A school bus is a vehicle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this example, <code>things</code> is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. </p>

<p>The <code>groupby()</code> function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. </p>

<p>Here, <code>lambda x: x[0]</code> tells <code>groupby()</code> to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.</p>

<p>In the above <code>for</code> statement, <code>groupby</code> returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.</p>

<p>Here's a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    listOfThings = "" and "".join([thing[1] for thing in group])
    print key + ""s:  "" + listOfThings + "".""
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you the output:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>animals: bear and duck.<br>
  plants: cactus.<br>
  vehicles: speed boat and school bus.</p>

I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/982"">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p>Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong><code>self</code></strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named <code>self</code> (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong><code>class.patch(obj)</code></strong> instead of just <strong><code>class.patch()</code></strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>

<p>Oh, and Ryan, <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monkey"">that</a> isn't exactly what I was looking for (it isn't a builtin functionality), but it is quite cool nonetheless.</p>
"
982,972.0,200.0,2008-08-04T02:31:13Z,14,,"<p>In Python monkey patching generally works by overwriting a class or functions signature with your own. Below is an example from the <a href=""http://wiki.zope.org/zope2/MonkeyPatch"">Zope Wiki</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters

<p>Using CGI is straightforward. Make sure your Apache config file has a cgi-bin set up. If not, follow their documentation (<a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html</a>). At that point all you need to do is place your Python scripts in the cgi-bin directory and the standard output will become the HTTP response. Refer to Python's documentation for further info (<a href=""https://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html</a>).</p>

<p>If you want to use a web framework you'll need to setup mod_python or FastCGI. These steps are dependent on which framework you want to use. Django provides clear instructions on how to setup mod_python and Django with Apache (<a href=""http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/</a>)</p>

<p>You can use <code>fetchall()</code> to get all rows at once.</p>

<p>It can be convenient to use this to create a Python list containing the values returned:</p>

<pre><code>curs.execute('select first_name from people')
names = [row[0] for row in curs.fetchall()]
</code></pre>

<p>This can be useful for smaller result sets, but can have bad side effects if the result set is large.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have to wait for the entire result set to be returned to
your client process.</p></li>
<li><p>You may eat up a lot of memory in your client to hold
the built-up list.</p></li>
<li><p>It may take a while for Python to construct and deconstruct the
list which you are going to immediately discard anyways.</p></li>

<hr>

<p>If you know there's a single row being returned in the result set you can call <code>fetchone()</code> to get the single row.</p>

<pre><code>curs.execute('select max(x) from t')
maxValue = curs.fetchone()[0]

<hr>

<p>Finally, you can loop over the result set fetching one row at a time.  In general, there's no particular advantage in doing this over using the iterator.</p>
