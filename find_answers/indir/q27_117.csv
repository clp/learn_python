<p>Given a font name returned by the API, I want to find the actual physical font file that that font name corresponds to on the disc.</p>

<p>This is all happening in a python program running on OSX so I guess I'm looking for one of:</p>

<li>Some Photoshop javascript</li>
<li>A Python function</li>
<li>An OSX API that I can call from python</li>

<p>I realize I could do this with hooks in most VCSes, but that requires that the tests run on the same machine as the version control server, which isn't as elegant as I would like. Does anyone have any suggestions for a small, user-friendly, open-source continuous integration system suitable for a Python codebase?</p>

Yes, I could have million keyword arguments and even more if statements in the function, but I was thinking more of an object oriented approach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a list - in this case, the children of an objectified <code>lxml</code> element</li>
<li>Divide it into groups based on some criteria</li>
<li>Then later iterate over each of these groups separately.</li>

<p>I've reviewed <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html"">the documentation</a>, and <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby"">the examples</a>, but I've had trouble trying to apply them beyond a simple list of numbers. </p>

<p>So, how do I use of <code>itertools.groupby()</code>?  Is there another technique I should be using?  Pointers to good ""prerequisite"" reading would also be appreciated.</p>

972,145,2008-08-04T02:17:51Z,364,Adding a Method to an Existing Object Instance,"<p>I've read that it is possible to add a method to an existing object (e.g. not in the class definition) in <strong>Python</strong>, I think this is called <em>Monkey Patching</em> (or in some cases <em>Duck Punching</em>). I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/982"">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p>Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong><code>self</code></strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named <code>self</code> (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong><code>class.patch(obj)</code></strong> instead of just <strong><code>class.patch()</code></strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method.</p>

<p><strong>It looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>

<p>Oh, and Ryan, <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monkey"">that</a> isn't exactly what I was looking for (it isn't a builtin functionality), but it is quite cool nonetheless.</p>

<p>I was easily able to find the answer for hex:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 0x12AF
    4783
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 0x100
    256

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; 01267
    695
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 0100
    64
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How do you use literals to express binary in Python?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Summary of Answers</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: can express binary using <code>int('01010101111',2)</code> but not with a literal.</li>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: there is <em>no way</em> to express binary literals.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so: <code>0b1100111</code> or <code>0B1100111</code>.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: will also allow <code>0o27</code> or <code>0O27</code> (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.</li>
<li>Python 3.0 beta: Same as 2.6, but will no longer allow the older <code>027</code> syntax for octals.</li>

<p>The problem is that <code>raw_input</code> (and input) require the user to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> after they make a selection. Is there any way to make the program act immediately upon a keystroke? Here's what I've got so far:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
print """"""Menu
1) Say Foo
2) Say Bar""""""
answer = raw_input(""Make a selection&gt; "")

if ""1"" in answer: print ""foo""
elif ""2"" in answer: print ""bar""

<p>It would be great to have something like</p>

<pre><code>print menu
while lastKey = """":
    lastKey = check_for_recent_keystrokes()
if ""1"" in lastKey: #do stuff...
</code></pre>
