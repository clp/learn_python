      <td>Cross Platform, Language Agnostic GUI Markup Language?</td>
      <td><p>I learned Swing back in the day but now I've moved to Python and want to make some apps with GUIs. I haven't had the time to learn a new GUI API so I've been using Jython, but I would prefer to use CPython. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be great if I can have one simple markup that allows me to switch GUI libraries. It would be even better if I can use the same markup language across languages so I can quickly make GUIs for any language I'm using. Does anyone know of such a markup/library?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've seen markups like Glade and wxWidget's markup (I forget the name). They're partly what I'm looking for (making a GUI without coding it in a language) but they're intertwined with a specific library. And neither are really nice looking or friendly to human editting.</p></td>

Python has a pretty excellent list comprehension system that lets you manipulate lists pretty elegantly, and depending on exactly what you want to accomplish, this can be done a couple of ways.  In essence, what you're doing is saying "For item in list if criteria.matches", and from that you can just iterate through the results or dump the results into a new list.</p>\n\n<p>I'm going to crib an example from <a href="http://diveintopython.net/functional_programming/filtering_lists.html" rel="nofollow">Dive Into Python</a> here, because it's pretty elegant and they're smarter than I am.  Here they're getting a list of files in a directory, then filtering the list for all files that match a regular expression criteria.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>    files = os.listdir(path)                               \n    test = re.compile("test\.py$", re.IGNORECASE)          \n    files = [f for f in files if test.search(f)]\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You could do this without regular expressions, for your example, for anything where your expression at the end returns true for a match.  There are other options like using the filter() function, but if I were going to choose, I'd go with this.</p>\n\n<p>Eric Sipple</p>\n</td>

When trying to see if a certain key exists within a dictionary in python (python's version of a hash table) there are two ways to check.  First is the <strong><code>has_key()</code></strong> method attached to the dictionary and second is the example given above.  It will return a boolean value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That should answer your question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now a little off topic to tie this in to the <em>list comprehension</em> answer previously given (for a bit more clarity).  <em>List Comprehensions</em> construct a list from a basic <em>for loop</em> with modifiers.  As an example (to clarify slightly), a way to use the <code>in dict</code> language construct in a _list comprehension_:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Say you have a two dimensional dictionary <strong><code>foo</code></strong> and you only want the second dimension dictionaries which contain the key <strong><code>bar</code></strong>.  A relatively straightforward way to do so would be to use a <em>list comprehension</em> with a conditional as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>#!/bin/python<br>baz = dict([(key, value) for key, value in foo if bar in value])<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Note the <strong><code>if bar in value</code></strong> at the end of the statement<strong>, this is a modifying clause which tells the <em>list comprehension</em> to only keep those key-value pairs which meet the conditional.</strong>  In this case <strong><code>baz</code></strong> is a new dictionary which contains only the dictionaries from foo which contain bar (Hopefully I didn't miss anything in that code example... you may have to take a look at the list comprehension documentation found in <a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node7.html#SECTION007140000000000000000" rel="nofollow">docs.python.org tutorials</a> and at <a href="http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk" rel="nofollow">secnetix.de</a>, both sites are good references if you have questions in the future.).</p></td>

      <td>Best way to abstract season/show/episode data</td>
      <td><p>Basically, I've written an API to www.thetvdb.com in Python. The current code can be found <a href="http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1<br></code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the "best" way to abstract this data within the Tvdb() class?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I originally used a extended Dict() that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = "something"</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = "something"</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently it's using four classes. ShowContainer, Show, Season and Episode. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the search() function on Show() for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's self.data dict, if not, raise season_not_found. Check in Season() if it has that episode and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <em>_getitem_</em> and <em>_setitem_</em> functions, it's easy to accidently recursively call <em>_getitem_</em> (so I'm not sure if extending the Dict class will cause problems)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old Ddict method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See _setItem and _setData. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly.. elegant..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the ShowContainer/etc classes with Dict cause problems?</p></td>

Tuples can be thought of as being similar to Pascal records or C structs; they're small collections of related data which may be of different types which are operated on as a group. For example, a Cartesian coordinate is appropriately represented as a tuple of two or three numbers.</p>\r\n  \r\n  <p>Lists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages. They tend to hold a varying number of objects all of which have the same type and which are operated on one-by-one.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally by convention you wouldn't choose a list or a tuple just based on its (im)mutability.  You would choose a tuple for small collections of completely different pieces of data in which a full-blown class would be too heavyweight, and a list for collections of any reasonable size where you have a homogeneous set of data.</p></td>
