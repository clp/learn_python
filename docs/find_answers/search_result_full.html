      <td>Adding a Method to an Existing Object Instance</td>
      <td><p>I've read that it is possible to add a method to an existing object (e.g. not in the class definition) in <strong>Python</strong>, I think this is called <em>Monkey Patching</em> (or in some cases <em>Duck Punching</em>). I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/982">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.</p>
<p>Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong><code>self</code></strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named <code>self</code> (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong><code>class.patch(obj)</code></strong> instead of just <strong><code>class.patch()</code></strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method.</p>
<p><strong>It looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>
<p>Oh, and Ryan, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monkey">that</a> isn't exactly what I was looking for (it isn't a builtin functionality), but it is quite cool nonetheless.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():

&gt;&gt;&gt; class A:

...         print "bar"

<p>Bound methods have been "bound" (how descriptive) to an instance, and that instance will be passed as the first argument whenever the method is called.</p>
<p>Callables that are attributes of a class (as opposed to an instance) are still unbound, though, so you can modify the class definition whenever you want:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def fooFighters( self ):
...     print "fooFighters"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; A.fooFighters = fooFighters
&gt;&gt;&gt; a2 = A()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a2.fooFighters
&lt;bound method A.fooFighters of &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x00A9BEB8&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a2.fooFighters()
fooFighters
</code></pre>
<p>Previously defined instances are updated as well (as long as they haven't overridden the attribute themselves):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.fooFighters()
fooFighters
</code></pre>
<p>The problem comes when you want to attach a method to a single instance:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def barFighters( self ):
...     print "barFighters"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters = barFighters
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: barFighters() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)
</code></pre>
<p>The function is not automatically bound when it's attached directly to an instance:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters
&lt;function barFighters at 0x00A98EF0&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To bind it, we can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/types.html?highlight=methodtype#module-types">MethodType function in the types module</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import types
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters = types.MethodType( barFighters, a )
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters
&lt;bound method ?.barFighters of &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x00A9BC88&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters()
barFighters
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a2.barFighters()
Traceback (most recent call last):

      <td><p>As Sebastjan said, <strong>you first have to sort your data. This is important.</strong></p>
<p>The part I didn't get is that in the example construction</p>
<pre><code>groups = []
uniquekeys = []
for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):
   groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list
   uniquekeys.append(k)
</code></pre>
<p><code>k</code> is the current grouping key, and <code>g</code> is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. In other words, the <code>groupby</code> iterator itself returns iterators.</p>
<p>Here's an example of that, using clearer variable names:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import groupby
things = [("animal", "bear"), ("animal", "duck"), ("plant", "cactus"), ("vehicle", "speed boat"), ("vehicle", "school bus")]
for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    for thing in group:
        print "A %s is a %s." % (thing[1], key)
    print " "
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you the output:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A bear is a animal.<br>
  A duck is a animal.</p>
  
  <p>A cactus is a plant.</p>
  
  <p>A speed boat is a vehicle.<br>
  A school bus is a vehicle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, <code>things</code> is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. </p>
<p>The <code>groupby()</code> function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. </p>
<p>Here, <code>lambda x: x[0]</code> tells <code>groupby()</code> to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.</p>
<p>In the above <code>for</code> statement, <code>groupby</code> returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.</p>
<p>Here's a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    listOfThings = " and ".join([thing[1] for thing in group])
    print key + "s:  " + listOfThings + "."
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you the output:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>animals: bear and duck.<br>
  plants: cactus.<br>
  vehicles: speed boat and school bus.</p>
</blockquote>

    groups.append(list(g))      # Store group iterator as a list
    uniquekeys.append(k)
</code></pre>
<p>So in your case, data is a list of nodes, keyfunc is where the logic of your criteria function goes and then <code>groupby()</code> groups the data.</p>
<p>You must be careful to <strong>sort the data</strong> by the criteria before you call <code>groupby</code> or it won't work. <code>groupby</code> method actually just iterates through a list and whenever the key changes it creates a new group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lists and tuples, while similar in many respects, are generally used in fundamentally different ways. Tuples can be thought of as being similar to Pascal records or C structs; they're small collections of related data which may be of different types which are operated on as a group. For example, a Cartesian coordinate is appropriately represented as a tuple of two or three numbers.</p>
  
  <p>Lists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages. They tend to hold a varying number of objects all of which have the same type and which are operated on one-by-one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally by convention you wouldn't choose a list or a tuple just based on its (im)mutability.  You would choose a tuple for small collections of completely different pieces of data in which a full-blown class would be too heavyweight, and a list for collections of any reasonable size where you have a homogeneous set of data.</p></td>

<ul>
<li><p>Pragmatically, they are great for packing and unpacking values (<code>x,y=coord</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>In combination with dictionaries (hash tables), they allow forms of mapping that would otherwise require many levels of association.  For example, consider marking that (x,y) has been found.</p>
<pre><code>// PHP
if (!isset($found[$x])) {
    $found[$x] = Array();

# Python
found[(x,y)] = True # parens added for clarity

<li><p>Lists should be used with the expectation of operations on its contents (hence the various mentions of immutability).  One will want to pop, push, splice, slice, search, insert before, insert after, etc with a list.</p></li>
<li><p>Tuples should be a low-level representation of an object, where simple comparisons are made, or operations such as extracting the n'th element or n elements in a predictable fashion, such as the coordinates example given earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, lists are not hashable, so the type of mapping done with dictionaries (hash tables in Perl, associative arrays in PHP) must be done with tuples.</p>
<p>Here's a simple example of tuples and dictionaries, together at last:</p>

doesLike is a dictionary mapping couples to True or False
"""

<p>I have developed a code-generator that takes our python interface to our C++ code (generated via SWIG) and generates code needed to expose this as WebServices.  When I developed this code I did it using TDD, but I've found my tests to be brittle as hell.  Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code (which happens to be a C++ header) I'd get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations.</p>
<p>The problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all.  That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a: complex, and b: brittle.</p>
<p>So I'm trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem, and it strikes me I'm perhaps tackling it the wrong way.  Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome, IE: does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to, rather than, does the code look the way I want it to.</p>

What you're really looking at here is system level testing (a.k.a. regression testing).  It's not just semantics... there are different mindsets, approaches, expectations, etc.  It's certainly more work, but you probably need to bite the bullet and set up an end-to-end regression test suite: fixed C++ files -> SWIG interfaces -> python modules -> known output.  You really want to check the known input (fixed C++ code) against expected output (what comes out of the final Python program).  Checking the code generator results directly would be like diffing object files...</p>

      <td><p>If you are running on *nux you might consider dumping the unittest framework in favor of a bash script or makefile. on windows you might consider building a shell app/function that runs the generator and then uses the code (as another process) and unittest that.</p>
<p>A third option would be to generate the code and then build an app from it that includes nothing but a unittest. Again you would need a shell script or whatnot to run this for each input. As to how to encode the expected behavior, it occurs to me that it could be done in much the same way as you would for the C++ code just using the generated interface rather than the C++ one.</p>

      <td><p>What is the best way to go about calling a function given a string with the function's name in a Python program.  For example, let's say that I have a module <code>foo</code>, and I have a string whose contents are <code>"bar"</code>. What is the best way to go about calling <code>foo.bar()</code>?</p>
<p>I need to get the return value of the function, which is why I don't just use <code>eval</code>. I figured out how to do it by using <code>eval</code> to define a temp function that returns the result of that function call, but I'm hoping that there is a more elegant way to do this.</p>

If you need to dynamically pick up the module as well, you can import it like:</p>
<pre><code>m = __import__ ('foo')
func = getattr(m,'bar')
func()

<p>As far as that goes, lines 2 and 3 can be compressed to:</p>
<pre><code>result = getattr(foo, 'bar')()

<p>if that makes more sense for your use case.  You can use <code>getattr</code> in this fashion on class instance bound methods, module-level methods, class methods... the list goes on.</p>
