      <td>How do I use Python's itertools.groupby()?</td>
      <td><p>I haven't been able to find an understandable explanation of how to actually use Python's <code>itertools.groupby()</code> function.  What I'm trying to do is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a list - in this case, the children of an objectified <code>lxml</code> element</li>
<li>Divide it into groups based on some criteria</li>
<li>Then later iterate over each of these groups separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've reviewed <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html">the documentation</a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby">the examples</a>, but I've had trouble trying to apply them beyond a simple list of numbers. </p>
<p>So, how do I use of <code>itertools.groupby()</code>?  Is there another technique I should be using?  Pointers to good "prerequisite" reading would also be appreciated.</p>

      <td><p>Can you show us your code?</p>
<p>The example on the Python docs is quite straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>groups = []
uniquekeys = []
for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):
    groups.append(list(g))      # Store group iterator as a list
    uniquekeys.append(k)
</code></pre>
<p>So in your case, data is a list of nodes, keyfunc is where the logic of your criteria function goes and then <code>groupby()</code> groups the data.</p>
<p>You must be careful to <strong>sort the data</strong> by the criteria before you call <code>groupby</code> or it won't work. <code>groupby</code> method actually just iterates through a list and whenever the key changes it creates a new group.</p>

      <td><p>As Sebastjan said, <strong>you first have to sort your data. This is important.</strong></p>
<p>The part I didn't get is that in the example construction</p>
<pre><code>groups = []
uniquekeys = []
for k, g in groupby(data, keyfunc):
   groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list
   uniquekeys.append(k)
</code></pre>
<p><code>k</code> is the current grouping key, and <code>g</code> is an iterator that you can use to iterate over the group defined by that grouping key. In other words, the <code>groupby</code> iterator itself returns iterators.</p>
<p>Here's an example of that, using clearer variable names:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import groupby
things = [("animal", "bear"), ("animal", "duck"), ("plant", "cactus"), ("vehicle", "speed boat"), ("vehicle", "school bus")]
for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    for thing in group:
        print "A %s is a %s." % (thing[1], key)
    print " "
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you the output:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A bear is a animal.<br>
  A duck is a animal.</p>
  
  <p>A cactus is a plant.</p>
  
  <p>A speed boat is a vehicle.<br>
  A school bus is a vehicle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, <code>things</code> is a list of tuples where the first item in each tuple is the group the second item belongs to. </p>
<p>The <code>groupby()</code> function takes two arguments: (1) the data to group and (2) the function to group it with. </p>
<p>Here, <code>lambda x: x[0]</code> tells <code>groupby()</code> to use the first item in each tuple as the grouping key.</p>
<p>In the above <code>for</code> statement, <code>groupby</code> returns three (key, group iterator) pairs - once for each unique key. You can use the returned iterator to iterate over each individual item in that group.</p>
<p>Here's a slightly different example with the same data, using a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>for key, group in groupby(things, lambda x: x[0]):
    listOfThings = " and ".join([thing[1] for thing in group])
    print key + "s:  " + listOfThings + "."
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you the output:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>animals: bear and duck.<br>
  plants: cactus.<br>
  vehicles: speed boat and school bus.</p>
</blockquote>

      <td>File size differences after copying a file to a server vÃ­a FTP</td>
      <td><p>I have created a PHP-script to update a webserver that is live inside a local directory.
I'm migrating the script into Python. It works fine for the most part, but after a PUT command the size of the file appears to change. Thus, the size of the file is different from that of the file on the server. </p>
<p>Once I download again the file from the FTP server, the only difference is the CR/LF mark. This annoys me because the same script is comparing the size of the files to update. Also, in case it means anything, the script works perfectly in PHP vÃ­a ftp_put.</p>

What the plugin does is rewriting all of the Buildbot urls so you can use Buildbot from within Trac. (http://example.com/tracbb).</p>

<p>The really nice thing about Buildbot is that the configuration is written in Python. You can integrate your own Python code directly to the configuration. It's also very easy to write your own BuildSteps to execute specific tasks.</p>

<p>We used BuildSteps to get the source from SVN, pull the dependencies, publish test results to WebDAV, etcetera.</p>

You have to create a file called sitecustomize.py and put it under python path (I put it under /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages, but that is differen on Win - it is c:\python\lib\site-packages or something), with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')

      <td><p>This is a difficult and open-ended question I know, but I thought I'd throw it to the floor and see if anyone had any interesting suggestions.</p>
<p>I have developed a code-generator that takes our python interface to our C++ code (generated via SWIG) and generates code needed to expose this as WebServices.  When I developed this code I did it using TDD, but I've found my tests to be brittle as hell.  Because each test essentially wanted to verify that for a given bit of input code (which happens to be a C++ header) I'd get a given bit of outputted code I wrote a small engine that reads test definitions from XML input files and generates test cases from these expectations.</p>
<p>The problem is I dread going in to modify the code at all.  That and the fact that the unit tests themselves are a: complex, and b: brittle.</p>
<p>So I'm trying to think of alternative approaches to this problem, and it strikes me I'm perhaps tackling it the wrong way.  Maybe I need to focus more on the outcome, IE: does the code I generate actually run and do what I want it to, rather than, does the code look the way I want it to.</p>
<p>Has anyone got any experiences of something similar to this they would care to share?</p>

<p>A third option would be to generate the code and then build an app from it that includes nothing but a unittest. Again you would need a shell script or whatnot to run this for each input. As to how to encode the expected behavior, it occurs to me that it could be done in much the same way as you would for the C++ code just using the generated interface rather than the C++ one.</p>

You really want to check the known input (fixed C++ code) against expected output (what comes out of the final Python program).

<blockquote>
  <p>Lists and tuples, while similar in many respects, are generally used in fundamentally different ways. Tuples can be thought of as being similar to Pascal records or C structs; they're small collections of related data which may be of different types which are operated on as a group. For example, a Cartesian coordinate is appropriately represented as a tuple of two or three numbers.</p>
  
  <p>Lists, on the other hand, are more like arrays in other languages. They tend to hold a varying number of objects all of which have the same type and which are operated on one-by-one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally by convention you wouldn't choose a list or a tuple just based on its (im)mutability.  You would choose a tuple for small collections of completely different pieces of data in which a full-blown class would be too heavyweight, and a list for collections of any reasonable size where you have a homogeneous set of data.</p></td>

<li><p>Pragmatically, they are great for packing and unpacking values (<code>x,y=coord</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>In combination with dictionaries (hash tables), they allow forms of mapping that would otherwise require many levels of association.  For example, consider marking that (x,y) has been found.</p>
<pre><code>// PHP
if (!isset($found[$x])) {
    $found[$x] = Array();

<li><p>Tuples should be a low-level representation of an object, where simple comparisons are made, or operations such as extracting the n'th element or n elements in a predictable fashion, such as the coordinates example given earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, lists are not hashable, so the type of mapping done with dictionaries (hash tables in Perl, associative arrays in PHP) must be done with tuples.</p>

<p><strong>How do you use literals to express binary in Python?</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong><em>Summary of Answers</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: can express binary using <code>int('01010101111',2)</code> but not with a literal.</li>
<li>Python 2.5 and earlier: there is <em>no way</em> to express binary literals.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so: <code>0b1100111</code> or <code>0B1100111</code>.</li>
<li>Python 2.6 beta: will also allow <code>0o27</code> or <code>0O27</code> (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.</li>
<li>Python 3.0 beta: Same as 2.6, but will no longer allow the older <code>027</code> syntax for octals.</li>

      <td>Adding a Method to an Existing Object Instance</td>
      <td><p>I've read that it is possible to add a method to an existing object (e.g. not in the class definition) in <strong>Python</strong>, I think this is called <em>Monkey Patching</em> (or in some cases <em>Duck Punching</em>). I understand that it's not always a good decision to do so. But, how might one do this?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 8/04/2008 00:21:01 EST:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/982">That</a> looks like a good answer John Downey, I tried it but it appears that it ends up being not a <em>true</em> method.</p>
<p>Your example defines the new patch function with an argument of <strong><code>self</code></strong>, but if you write actual code that way, the now patched class method asks for an argument named <code>self</code> (it doesn't automagically recognize it as the object to which it is supposed to bind, which is what would happen if defined within the class definition), meaning you have to call <strong><code>class.patch(obj)</code></strong> instead of just <strong><code>class.patch()</code></strong> if you want the same functionality as a <em>true</em> method.</p>
<p><strong>It looks like Python isn't really treating it as a method, but more just as a variable which happens to be a function</strong> (and as such is callable).  Is there any way to attach an actual method to a class?</p>
<p>Oh, and Ryan, <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/monkey">that</a> isn't exactly what I was looking for (it isn't a builtin functionality), but it is quite cool nonetheless.</p>

      <td><p>In Python, there is a difference between functions and bound methods.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...     print "foo"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
...     def bar( self ):
...         print "bar"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = A()
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo

&gt;&gt;&gt; a.bar
&lt;bound method A.bar of &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x00A9BC88&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Bound methods have been "bound" (how descriptive) to an instance, and that instance will be passed as the first argument whenever the method is called.</p>
<p>Callables that are attributes of a class (as opposed to an instance) are still unbound, though, so you can modify the class definition whenever you want:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def fooFighters( self ):
...     print "fooFighters"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; A.fooFighters = fooFighters
&gt;&gt;&gt; a2 = A()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a2.fooFighters
&lt;bound method A.fooFighters of &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x00A9BEB8&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a2.fooFighters()
fooFighters
</code></pre>
<p>Previously defined instances are updated as well (as long as they haven't overridden the attribute themselves):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.fooFighters()
fooFighters
</code></pre>
<p>The problem comes when you want to attach a method to a single instance:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def barFighters( self ):
...     print "barFighters"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters = barFighters
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: barFighters() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)
</code></pre>
<p>The function is not automatically bound when it's attached directly to an instance:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters
&lt;function barFighters at 0x00A98EF0&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To bind it, we can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/types.html?highlight=methodtype#module-types">MethodType function in the types module</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import types
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters = types.MethodType( barFighters, a )
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters
&lt;bound method ?.barFighters of &lt;__main__.A instance at 0x00A9BC88&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.barFighters()
barFighters
</code></pre>
<p>This time other instances of the class have not been affected:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a2.barFighters()
Traceback (most recent call last):

<pre><code>for row in curs.fetchall():

<p>It can be convenient to use this to create a Python list containing the values returned:</p>
<pre><code>curs.execute('select first_name from people')
names = [row[0] for row in curs.fetchall()]

<p>This can be useful for smaller result sets, but can have bad side effects if the result set is large.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You have to wait for the entire result set to be returned to
your client process.</p></li>
<li><p>You may eat up a lot of memory in your client to hold
the built-up list.</p></li>
<li><p>It may take a while for Python to construct and deconstruct the
list which you are going to immediately discard anyways.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you know there's a single row being returned in the result set you can call <code>fetchone()</code> to get the single row.</p>
<pre><code>curs.execute('select max(x) from t')
maxValue = curs.fetchone()[0]

<p>Finally, you can loop over the result set fetching one row at a time.  In general, there's no particular advantage in doing this over using the iterator.</p>

If not, follow their documentation (<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html" rel="nofollow">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html</a>).
