README

Last Updated Thu2016_0421_12:00 

This is the README for software that demonstrates the use of the
indeed-python module, to get data from indeed.com using their API.



# Intro

This release includes two programs.

  search_indeed_api.py retrieves job listings based on query
  parameters from the indeed.com web site using its API.

  get_details_indeed_api.py retrieves details about specific
  job listings based on jobkey values from the indeed.com
  web site using its API.


Ref: https://github.com/indeedlabs/indeed-python
  The github site has a README file with some example code.

Ref: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/indeed
  A client library for using the Indeed.com Jobsearch API.


You need a Publisher Number from indeed.com to use their
API.  See this page to create an account (it was free and
quick for me):
  http://www.indeed.com/publisher/



# Example code.

Examples of using the API to get job data interactively in ipython.
  1.  Insert your own value for PUBLISHER_NUMBER.
  2.  Insert valid values for jobkeys (jk1 and jk2); find the
      keys by running the search program.


## Example 1.  Search for keywords.

from indeed import IndeedClient
client = IndeedClient('PUBLISHER_NUMBER')

params = {
    'q' : "python entry",
    'l' : "94063",
    'userip' : '1.2.3.4', 
    'useragent' : "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2)"  }

search_response = client.search(**params)

keys_l = ['jobtitle', 'company', 'city', 'date',  'snippet', 'jobkey']
for k in keys_l:
    print search_response['results'][0][k]

## Example 2.  Get details of specific jobs.

jk2 = "6bb8f41ea97bd6f8"
job_response = client.jobs(jobkeys = (jk1, jk2))

keys_l = ['jobtitle', 'company', 'city', 'date',  'snippet']
for k in keys_l:
    print job_response['results'][1][k]
