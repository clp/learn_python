site.

  Requests: HTTP for Humans

  Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests, without the
  need for manual labor. There's no need to manually add
  query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST
  data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100%
  automatic, powered by urllib3, which is embedded within
  Requests.
  (From the module's documentation.)



Example of using the requests module interactively in ipython.

import requests
url22 = 'http://www.indeed.com'
resp = requests.get(url22)
print resp

url23 = 'http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=python&l=Work+at+Home'
resp = requests.get(url23)

help(requests)

resp.json
resp.text
resp.content
resp.status_code
resp.headers
resp.cookies
